### Prerequisites

Make sure your development environment has the necessary prerequisites.

1. [Node.js (v16.x)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) â€“ we use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions.

2. [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/cli) to manage Shopify apps.

3. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) â€“ you could also use another editor, but this helps us guarantee linter/formatter features.

4. [Volar VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) â€“ Vue 3 language support (turn off vetur and ts/js language features if you have problems arising from conflicts).

5. [Eslint VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) â€“ linter and formatter.

### Setup

Clone the repository, checkout a new branch from the master copy, and install all dependencies.
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/localgoods/heythanks.git
cd heythanks
git pull
git checkout -b feature/tip-more master
npm install
```

> This will install all workspace dependencies for this monorepo.

### Environment

Create a `.env` in the root directory and add your local Shopify app configuration.
```
SHOPIFY_API_KEY="your-api-key"
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET="your-api-secret"
SHOP="your-shop-url"
SCOPES=write_script_tags,write_products,read_themes,read_fulfillments,read_orders,read_products,read_customers
HOST="your-ngrok-url"
DATABASE_URL="your-postgres-url"
```

### Cart widget

Run the development server for the cart widget.
```zsh
npm run serve:cart-widget
```

### Admin app

Run the development server for the default application (the admin app) and backend services.
```zsh
npm run serve
```

## Usage

### Postgres

There are two main operations for setting up and maintaining our PG DBs. Both are shown below with the example values representing our local environment (but the same operations are used for production). For testing changes and sandboxing queries, [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) is a good app to download and configure to access HT DBs.

Dump migrations from an existing DB (to download the HT schema).

```zsh
pg_dump -h localhost -p 5432 -U ianherrington -d postgres -f ./heythanks_pg.sql
# Then enter password...
```

Migrate a DB (to upload or update the HT schema).

```zsh
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U ianherrington -d postgres -f ./heythanks_pg.sql
# Then enter password...
```
